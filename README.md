# jBolota

A Java port of the [Bolota](https://github.com/nathanpc/bolota) outliner 
note-taking application.

## Requirements

This application is designed to be as cross-platform as possible and run on 
as many old system as Java allows, so all that you are required to have is a 
**Java 1.5** runtime environment.

## Motivation

Although the original Bolota application for Windows is extremely comprehensive
and took a great deal of time to build, I wanted to create a version of the 
application that would be truly cross-platform and backwards compatible as 
to support all the weird and wonderful devices that I use every single day.
